INSTRUCTIONS
Create a form at posts#new to create a new post.
  The form should include check boxes for us to select categories
    as well as a text field to create a new category.
    You should do this with a nested form so that our controller stays thin.
  Also, typing in a Category name that already exists should not create a new category.
    Instead, if we type in a category that already exists, we should select it from the database
    and associate the post we've created with the existing category.

Create a posts#show page to display the following:
  The title and content of the post.
  All of the comments associated with the post.
  A list of all the unique users who have commented on the post.
    A user's name should only show up once in this section, even if they've commented multiple times.

    Also, the select box that we use for the users needs to have a blank option ––
    check out the include_blank option for collection_select.

  A form to add a new comment. The form should have a drop-down menu to select a user
    (we'll change this in future lessons to automatically associate the comment with a logged-in user).
    We should also be able to create a new user here and automatically associate it with the post.

    When creating new comments, we should only create a new user if they filled in that input.
    accepts_nested_attributes_for has a reject_if option that you can configure to only create new records if all the fields aren't blank.


Create a users#show page that links to all of the posts a user has commented on.

Create a categories#show page that links to all of the posts associated with a given category.
